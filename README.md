# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
The "Stock Market Prediction using LSTM" project focuses on building a robust stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. By leveraging real-time data from the yfinance library, this project aims to enhance accuracy and reliability in financial forecasting. The LSTM model captures long-term dependencies in historical stock data, achieving a high R2 score of 0.97 and a mean absolute error of 4.63%, demonstrating its ability to explain stock price variance effectively. The project includes comprehensive evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE, along with visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices, showcasing the model's trend-following capabilities and potential for aiding financial gains.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to predict stock prices accurately. By optimizing hyperparameters and training the LSTM model on historical stock data, the goal is to provide reliable and insightful financial forecasts that can help investors make informed decisions.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python:** Core language for model development and data processing.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** Frameworks for building and training the LSTM neural networks.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis for handling historical stock data.
- **yfinance:** Library for obtaining real-time financial data.
- **Machine Learning:** Techniques for predictive modeling and evaluation.
